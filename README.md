## StormReady
StormReady is an informative hurricane preparation app developed by Syed Rizvi.

The aim of the app is to increase the awareness of users about the formation and dangers of hurricanes events,
as well as provide a convenient hub for viewing active and past hurricane locations. By providing relevant 
information and safety tips in one place, the hope is that users become better informed and are encouraged to 
prepare ahead of time for dangerous weather events.
