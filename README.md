# StormReady

StormReady is an informative hurricane preparation app developed by Syed Rizvi.

The aim of the app is to increase the awareness of users about the formation of hurricanes and the specific 
dangers commonly encountered during severe storm events. By providing helpful tips and relevant information, 
the hope is that people are better informed and encouraged to prepare ahead of time for dangerous weather 
events.

Features of the app include:
- Helpful tips for storm preparation and avoiding danger during weather events
- A Question/Answer/Feedback system designed to hint users towards important information about hurricanes
- Push notifications
- User location tracking
- A map of all active hurricane locations globally


This app was developed using React Native/Expo and Firebase. Hurricane location information is drawn from
the Aeris Weather API.
